  "description": "Lists species that have names or descriptions matching the search terms.\n\nVarious modifiers are supported for filtering results: `group`, `zone`, `role`, `name`, `owner`, `status`, `taxon`, and `random`, as well as `genus`, `family`, and so on.\n\nThe `name` modifier can be used to change how species names are displayed. For example, `name:species` will show the species name without the genus. Other options include `full`, `short`, and `common`.\n\nThe `group` modifier sorts the results into groupings. For example, to group by zone, use `group:zone`. Supported groupings are `zone`, `genus`, `owner`, `status`, and `role`.\n\nThe `random` modifier will return some random subset of the results (e.g. `random:10`).\n\nModifiers that filter the results can also be negated (e.g. To exclude all species in the \"cornu\" genus, use `-genus:cornu`).\n\nOther modifiers include `status:(extinct|extant)`, `sort:(age|size|count)`, `predator:(species)`, `prey:(species)`, `ancestor:(species)`, and `has:(prey|predator|ancestor)`.",
